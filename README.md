# About VariantFormatter
VariantValidator is a software tool designed to accept genomic level sequence variant 
descriptions in the pseudo-VCF or HGVS formats (see MANUAL.md), and automatically generate 
relevant transcript-level and protein-level HGVS variant descriptions.

VariantFormatter interfaces with a custom version of the hgvs package to parse, format, 
and manipulate biological sequence variants.  
See https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/ for details of the hgvs package
See https://github.com/openvar/vv_hgvs for the custom version of the hgvs package


## Features

The basic functionality of VariantFormatter is documentes in the MANUAL.md

VariantFormatter simultaneously and accurately projects genomic sequence variations onto 
all overlapping transcript reference sequences

VariantFormatter can be used as a variant-by-variant processor or as a batch processor

Alternatively, genomic sequence variation can be projected onto a specified single, or 
specified subset of transcript reference sequences for any given gene

Projection of sequence variations between reference sequences takes account of 
discrepancies between genomic and transcript reference sequences, thus ensuring an 
accurate prediction of the effect on encoded proteins for every gene
